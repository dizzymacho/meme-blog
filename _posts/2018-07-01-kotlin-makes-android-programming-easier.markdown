Kotlin is a modern language that was created to improve some of the pain points that developers have encountered over the many years of using Java and other similar languages. It was first released in July 2011 and has been improved upon many times since as it gathers steam in the Android community.

And while it is a relatively new language, the good news is that Kotlin is interoperable with Java, meaning that developers can continue to use the Java Libraries they already know how to use. Legacy code written in Java can easily be migrated to Kotlin, making it easier to gradually transition current apps to the new language.

### Fewer Bugs, Better Code

Your developers are excited about Kotlin because it makes their lives easier. Something that used to require hundreds of lines of code may now require just a few lines in Kotlin. It essentially allows developers to do all the same things that they are currently doing in Java, but with less code. And less code means fewer bugs and less time required to manage and update the app in the long run.

Kotlin also reduces bugs in code because it enforces constraints that let developers sidestep errors often seen in older languages, providing them with the ability to discover issues within the code as it is written. This empowers developers to find and fix issues before they affect users, ultimately leading to a better user experience, higher Play Store reviews and more downloads.

{% highlight kotlin %}
package hello

fun main(args: Array<String>) {
  printIn("Hello World!")
}
{% endhighlight %}

### The Future of Kotlin

Kotlin is not a magical solution to all Android development problems, but it does make solving them easier. Because Kotlin works well with Java, developers can convert a single file from Java to Kotlin mid-project, without having to rewrite old Java code. And while this means that you don’t have to move to Kotlin, at least not immediately, it is time to start to plan for the transition.

Android developers at prominent companies like Basecamp and Pinterest have already switched over to Kotlin and have begun to see the benefits in their projects as it has improved work quality and speed. And as more and more companies start to rely on
Kotlin to help their developers become more efficient, the new
language needs to be front of mind.


### Ready to Make the Switch?

Kotlin won’t fully replace Java today, but it is the way forward. Training your developers now will free them to improve current projects, create new projects more efficiently and experiment with
new technologies to drive your business forward.
